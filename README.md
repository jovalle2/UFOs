## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### Results

With the changes that have been made a more seemless experince would be had as you would get the information filter right away instead of having to click on a button.

With that change it could also cause issues with someone not being sure what to do to get the results. Another issue I had found was that it is case sensitive so more work would be needed to make it easier for a user to use.
